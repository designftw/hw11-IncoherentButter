        <p class="description">
            I plan for my ultimate design to be a version of this chat app that contains the following features: 
            a dynamic color management system that lets users choose to apply multiple different colors to different 
            threads and manage them in a usable way (i.e. remove colors, change colors, filter for threads of certain colors), and a 
            more functional automatic coloring of messages in threads (my current implementation does not functionally color
            past messages or future messages in a given thread). 

        </p>    

        <p class="description">
            It should ideally be capable of supporting the usage of the same color 
            to track up to one thread at a time in different channels (so, two different channels can both have a red thread), applying color to messages 
            by right clicking them and selecting on the message itself, and the usage of alternative color palettes, but these are lower priority 
            features.
        </p>
            
        <p class="description">
            The color-based features described here are essentially the same as in my Figma mockup; the specific inclusion of color palettes is an 
            expansion, in fact. I am cutting back expectations on the less color-related features such as notification bumping and more dynamic 
            "community" management (which would be a good bit more complicated than channels)

            How this is a halfway point

        <p class="description">
            At this point, I've implemented the foundational feature of the app, i.e. the coloring of messages on click. This represents a rough 
            halfway point because I implemented most of my feature on a scale of one (I used one color and allowed for selecting one message); 
            the next stage involves expanding to allow for using <em>n</em> color to dynamically handle a larger number of messages per thread.

            Additionally, the next stage should require expanding on just one more large component for Color Management, 
            while this milestone involved the scaffolding of the rudimentary Color Management component and the fleshing out of 
            both the app component and reply component.
